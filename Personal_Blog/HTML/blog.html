            Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis
            from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

            <li>
              <span class="label">Who is using cloud computing?</span> Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and
              customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to
              deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

            AWS has more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider, including compute, storage, databases, networking, data lakes and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, IoT, security, and much more. AWS provides a comprehensive portfolio
            of solutions that help you solve common problems and build faster using the AWS platform. Every AWS Solution comes with detailed architecture, a deployment guide, and instructions for both automated and manual deployment.
